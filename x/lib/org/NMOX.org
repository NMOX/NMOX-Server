* NMOX: New Media On X
** NMOX stands for /New Media On X/—a cross-language meta-framework for building the web.

** What Does the "X" Stand For?

The "X" in NMOX represents three core concepts:

*** 1. Data (/Peace/)

X Object Becomes Text: Data transforms into text.
Model Equivalent: Functions like the Model in MVC architecture.
Represents Peace: Data at rest, elegantly encapsulated in string form.

*** 2. Functionality (/Love/)

Serialization & Deserialization: Bringing data to life.
Controller Equivalent: Acts as the Controller, managing data flow.
Represents Love: Recognizing the shared spark in all elements.

*** 3. Order (/Harmony/)

UniX Philosophy Orders Data: Embracing simplicity and efficiency.
View Equivalent: Similar to the View, presenting organized data.
Represents Harmony: Data arrays playing smoothly together.

** Peace, Love, and Harmony

Peace: Data at rest in perfect string form.
Love: Connection between data pieces through serialization.
Harmony: Seamless orchestration of data working together.

Experience the fusion of Peace, Love, and Harmony with NMOX—building the web with elegance and joy!
