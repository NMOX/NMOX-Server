    <h1>Welcome to NMOX</h1>
    
    <h2>What is NMOX?</h2>
    <p>NMOX (New Media On X) is a meta-framework that bridges the gap
        between traditional UNIX philosophy and modern web development.
        It builds on a central X object across multiple programming languages,
        providing a unified approach to web development with Docker-centric deployment.</p>
    
    <p>Key features include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>UNIX-inspired architecture and file system structure</li>
        <li>Multi-language support (C, Perl, Go, Dart, Ruby, Python, PHP, Clojure, and Rust)</li>
        <li>Docker-based deployment and development environment</li>
        <li>Built-in support for modern web standards</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nginx</h2>
    <p>Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance HTTP server,
        reverse proxy, and load balancer that serves as NMOX's default
        static file server. Selected for its exceptional efficiency and
        small footprint, Nginx excels at serving static content and can
        handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal resource
        usage. In NMOX's Docker implementation, Nginx runs on Alpine Linux,
        resulting in a lightweight container that's perfect for both development
        and production environments. While NMOX supports other web servers,
        Nginx's UNIX-like configuration style and robust feature set make it
        an ideal default choice for serving NMOX applications.</p>
    <p>NMOX Server works seamlessly with Nginx. It is intended that you fire up
        the Docker container and start serving your static files immediately.
        You can find the Dockerfile for Nginx in x/Docker/nmox-nginx.Dockerfile
    </p>

    <h2>Quick Start with Docker</h2>
    <p>To get started with NMOX's static file serving capability:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Clone the NMOX repository to your local machine</li>
        <li>Navigate to the project directory</li>
        <li>Build the Docker image with:
            <pre>docker build -t nmox-static .</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Run the container with:
            <pre>docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name nmox-static nmox-static</pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Your static files will be served from <code>x/usr/share/nginx/html</code> within the container. To serve your own static files, you can mount a local directory:</p>

    <pre>docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd)/static:/usr/share/nginx/html --name nmox-static nmox-static</pre>

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>NMOX embodies three core principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Peace:</strong> Represented through Strings - resolution and clarity in code</li>
        <li><strong>Love:</strong> Represented through the X object - finding commonality across different languages and systems</li>
        <li><strong>Harmony:</strong> Represented through Arrays - bringing different components together</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Help</h2>
    <p>NMOX is an open-source project designed for UNIX-savvy developers and system administrators. For more information:</p>
