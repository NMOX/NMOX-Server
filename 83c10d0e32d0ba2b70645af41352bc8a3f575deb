# Infrastructure Modernization Notes

## Summary
Complete infrastructure overhaul for NMOX Server v3, introducing modern DevOps practices while maintaining the project's unique philosophy.

## Key Changes
1. **Containerization**: Full Docker setup with multi-stage builds
2. **Automation**: CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions
3. **Tooling**: npm, Cargo, and Make integration
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test infrastructure
5. **Development**: Enhanced DX with hot reload and VNC access

## Migration Guide
For existing users:
1. Run `make setup` to initialize new environment
2. Copy existing .env values to new .env file
3. Run `make quickstart` for full setup
4. Use `make dev` instead of old startup scripts

## Breaking Changes
- None for existing functionality
- New directory requirements in x/lib/{rust,wasm}
- Requires Node.js 20+ and Docker

## Performance Impact
- Reduced build times with Docker caching
- Optimized WASM builds with proper profiles
- Nginx caching for static assets

## Security Improvements
- Non-root Docker containers
- Security headers in Nginx
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Environment variable protection

## Next Steps
- Add Kubernetes manifests
- Implement monitoring with Prometheus
- Set up distributed tracing
- Create Helm charts

This modernization sets the foundation for scaling NMOX Server while preserving its UNIX philosophy and live programming capabilities.
