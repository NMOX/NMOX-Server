# NMOX-Server

New Media On X Server

## Overview

NMOX-Server is a comprehensive framework designed to build modern media applications based on the Unix philosophy. At the core of NMOX-Server is an object called "x". This versatile object can represent a PAGE, an API, or various other entities. "X" symbolizes UNIX, emphasizing the principles of modularity, simplicity, and portability that underpin UNIX systems.

By conceptualizing web-connected entities as objects (or structs in languages like C, Go, Rust), NMOX-Server ensures that standards permeate every aspect of your project. For example, the `P` object creates a Paragraph, while the `DIV` object creates a Division. These objects can be composed to form standards-compliant pages, APIs, or other instances of "x".

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Build applications using a consistent object-oriented approach.
- **Standards Compliance**: Ensures adherence to web standards and UNIX principles.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend and customize objects to fit specific needs.

## Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

NMOX-Server adheres to the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard) to ensure compatibility with *NIX systems. This standard defines the directory structure and directory contents in UNIX-like operating systems, ensuring a predictable environment.
